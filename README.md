## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Bipedal Robotics Reinforcement Learning Research

> Sun Yat-sen University, 2020.9 - 2021.1

- Role: team leader, Mentor: Prof. Liang Lin
- Research in bipedal robotics walking control method. Achieved an automatic solution for
bipedal robot walking control by reinforcement learning.
- In gym with PyTorch, used Walker2D to delve into factors of RL algorithm. Using SAC
algorithm, achieve precisely walking in complex 2D circumstance, and simply straight
walking in 3D circumstance.

### View Fusion of Multiple Cameras based on OpenCV Aruco 
> Sun Yat-sen University, 2019.2-2020.1

- Role: team leader, Mentor: Xiaohua Xie, Associate Professor
- A project of scientific research internship in the lab of Prof. Xiaohua Xie.
- Propose an image overlapping area positioning and fusion method for pedestrian trajectory tracking between multiple vertical cameras, based on OpenCV Aruco.
- The method is eventually integrated into the laboratory's camera products and applied to
wide-area passenger trajectory tracking.

### AUVSI Foundation International Aerial Robotics Competition 
> Sun Yat-sen University, 2018.9-2019.7

- Role: team member , Mentor: Hui Cheng, Professor
- Mission 8 in IARC, target to achieve a drone system to recognize and decode divided QR codes in complex environment.
- Contributed to 1/4 QR code recognition system and image enhancement system, optimizing the performance of drones when shaking, low light, and blurry.
- Team won the second prize and was the first one to achieve the mission
