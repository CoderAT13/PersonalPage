Team leader, Sun Yat-sen University, 2020.9 - 2021.1

- Mentor: [Liang Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nav8m8gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), Professor
- Research in bipedal robotics walking control method. Achieved an automatic solution for
bipedal robot walking control by reinforcement learning.
- In gym with PyTorch, used Walker2D to delve into factors of RL algorithm. Using SAC
algorithm, achieve precisely walking in complex 2D circumstance, and simply straight
walking in 3D circumstance.
